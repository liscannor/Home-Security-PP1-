## Design

### Colour Scheme

The website uses 3 main colours that correspond to the colours used in the logo of the website. 

* I have used `#32362E` & `#000000` as the primary colour used for the text.
* I have used `#FEDD01` as the secondary colour used for  the sites background-colour and used for the accent colour the text.
* I have used `#ffffff` as the colour used for the site background-colour and used for the accent colour the text.

![Home Security Website Colour Palette](documentacion/Security.png)


### Typography

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to import the chosen fonts for use in the site.

* For the Page Title I have used the google font [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?preview.text=Nadiiy&query=Montserrat&sort=popularity). It is a serif font.


* For the body of the page I have used the google font [Barlow Condensed](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Barlow+Condensed?preview.text=Nadiiy&query=Barlow+Condensed+&sort=popularity). It is a sans-serif font.  


### Imagery

The logo was used with the permission of his owner. The images were taken from the [unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/), that fit the theme of the site.

### Wireframes

Wireframe was created for only mobile version using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/).

![Home Page - mobile](documentacion/wireframe.png)

### Features

The website is comprised of a home page, a gallery page, a keep in touch page and a thank you page.

All Pages on the website are responsive and have:

* A favicon in the browser tab.

![favicon](documentacion/feat-logo.png)

* A responsive navigation bar at the top which allows the user to navigate through the site.  To the left of the navigation bar is a logo company together with the text Home Security. To the right of the navigation bar are the links to the websites pages (home, gallery, and ckeep in touch). On mobile devices the navigation links change to a burger toggler.

* A footer which contains two blocks. First blocks contains social media icon links to facebook, instagram and twitter. Second blocks shows contact information, such as phone number and email address with appropriate icons. The icons were used to keep the footer more clean, give more space and because they are universally recognisable.

#### Home Page.

  * Hero Section.
  The hero shows a image of a camara on the wall.
  * About Us Section.
  This section is broken down into three subsections: two paragraphs and one image. Text describe the company and its mission.
  * Why Choose Us Section gives the user information about benefits, if he/she choose this company. Its is presented as text and the icons.

![Home Page](documentacion/homepage.png)

#### Gallery Page.

    Gallery page includes a set of pictures that show what the company does and what services it provides.

![Gallery Page](documentacion/gallerypage.png)

#### Keep In Touch Page.

* Background picture related to the company's activity.
* This section-form gives the user opportunity to leave a request to be contacted by a company employee.

![Keep In Touch Page](documentacion/keepintouch.png)

#### Thank you Page.

* Background of the page is white color for not to overload the user's perception and not to distract his attention from the main thing.
* The section has only two headers that give the users feedback on their subscription.

![Thank You Page](documentacion/thankyoupage.png)

#### Future Implementations

In future implementations I would like to:

1 Create a page with product cards and services.
2 Give users the option to order goods from the site.
3 Create a basket of goods and services.

### Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. I have achieved this by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
* Using a hover state on all buttons on the site to make it clear to the user if they are hovering over a button.
* Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
* Ensuring menus are accessible by marking the current page as current for screen readers.

### Solved Bugs

1. Logo and text in the header were not on the same line and no styles could help. A friend gave me a tip to change the html structure: remove the list where these elements were. Instead just put the logo and text in one link. It was a great solution.
2. In the about section of the desktop screen, the items should display in a single line in the centre. I used align-items:baseline and was sure it was a good solution and spent a lot of time applying other styles to align the items vertically. I should have just used align-items:centre though.
3. The form on screens larger than 768px had to fixed to the centre of the screen. I didn't know how to implement it. I found the solution on Google. I applayed to the form the set styles:top: 50%;left: 50% transform: translate(-50%, -50%);.
